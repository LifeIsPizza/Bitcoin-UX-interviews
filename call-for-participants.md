# Call for participants: UX research interviews

## About this research
This is an open source research effort with the objective of helping shape design decisions in Bitcoin, where the user's best interest will be in mind.
It's conducted by an independent UX researcher called [Patrícia Estevão](https://patestevao.com/), enabled by a grant from [Square Crypto](https://squarecrypto.org/#grants).
Our main objective is to make publicly available qualitative user insights about their story with Bitcoin, through the means of user interviews, that would better inform future product and software decisions based on actual user needs.

## Disclaimer
This document describes how I intend to go about the research, and I'm commited to do it. However, I might have to review some details, particularly concerning legal and financial aspects if I'm professionally councelled to do so. Any changes to the terms I'm setting forth will be reflected here and directly communicated to potential interviewees so they can make an informed decision of whether they are still interested in moving forward. 

## Interviews: pros and cons
Since there are already many research initiatives made public which focus on surveys and quantitative analisys, we decided to focus our efforts in a less served area of Bitcoin research: the qualitative insights from deep-dives into people's stories. This choice will certainly raise challenges, such as the need to share more personal information than a survey would require. However, we intend to do our best to overcome this by minimizing the retrieval of identifiable information and by keeping a very transparent approach regarding what will be recorded, used or made public.

## Methodology and Privacy: what to expect
The nature of the user interview methodology implies the need for some personal information or, we could say, a personal story. The reason why we find it important is because it allows us to understand in much more depth the context, the problems and the life-situations that surround Bitcoin usage for some groups of people. In other words, we are able to design for people's problems instead of just optimizing the way they use an interface.

That said, you can expect from us the following approach to data collecting:
- You'll need to fill-out a screening form. Most fields in the form are optional, you can fill out only what you're comfortable with. However, we might prioritize candidates that we better understand the background.
- Users are not going to be required to share their real name. We just need something that we can call you while we're talking, but you can decide what that is (a first name, a nickname, the name of a book character, whatever works for you).
- Interviews will be made with audio only.
- The audio from interviews will be recorded but will not be made public. The recording is to allow me to focus on our conversation during the interview and still be able to come back to what you told me later on.
- What is expected to go public from interviews: a few transcribed quotes; treated information from the interviews transformed into insights (e.g. "a user is likely to use Bitcoin on a holiday trip"); demograhic data (such as the countries participants were from), although we intend to be quite flexible with what people are required to share.
- Legal: Participants will have to consent to the data processing.

## "Can I be recruited for an interview?"
At the moment, we are preferrably looking for people who:
- Have used Bitcoin at least once in their life.
- Are willing to receive the participation incentive in Bitcoin.
- Can spare 1 hour for an inteview.
- Are willing to share their personal story surrounding Bitcoin (you can skip any information that might be too specific).
- Are older than 18 years old and over the age of majority in their country of residence.

If you've checked yes for all, you're welcome to volunteer and take the screening questionnaire.

## Participant step-by-step: What to expect
* You've read this document, you've fit the profile we are looking for, and you are interested in being interviewed.
* You'll take the screening questionnaire, so we understand a bit your profile.
* If you are selected, we'll contact you via e-mail or other method you choose to set up all the practical details (how we'll talk, at what time, how should I call you, etc). We'll also ask that you share a Bitcoin address for your incentive payment.
* We'll talk for 1 hour about you, how you started using Bitcoin and how it fits into your life. At the end of the call, we'll ask you to confirm the address that you sent us.
* We'll send you a Bitcoin payment with the participation incentive (equivalent to US$100 at the time of sending).
* We're all done!

## FAQ
*"I'd like to help but I'm unsure because there might be things I'd rather not share. What do I do?"*

No question is mandatory throughout the interview, you can decide whether you are comfortable or not sharing an information, or how much of it you'd like to share. That said, of course we are looking for some legitimate sharing and people might feel embarassed to say no once they agreed with the interview, so here are a few things you can rest assured we'll not ask:
- How many Bitcoins you own.
- Which specific wallet you use.
- Your home address or specific details about you neighboorhod.
- Names of people you have relationships with.
- Your employer.

Also, feel free to message us at btcuxresearch@gmail.com if you have any specific questions about the process that would make you feel more comfortable.

*Are there right or wrong answers in the screening questionnaire?*

No. Despite what it could seem, there isn't an answer or a profile that will make you more likely to be selected. That's because I'm actively looking for a variety of profiles. So whether you are a frequent user that knows a lot about Bitcoin or a one-time user who wasn't really sure what you were doing, it's best to answer truthfully, because I might be looking for someone just like you.
